Made with :heart: and Redux-zero.

## :fire: Why Redux-zero as a state manager?

[Redux-zero](https://github.com/redux-zero/redux-zero) is a lightweight state container based on Redux.
I would like to share 3 arguments to choose redux-zero over redux.

1. Is lighter(less than 1kb) than redux and in projects that are not necessarily high usage of reducers, it helps to focus on what is important.
2. I participated in the conception of this lib, made mostly by an ex-coworker.
3. I'm currently focusing my career in leadership and share knowledge that I've learned across these years, so would be
   an honor gives a presentation about this amazing library.
